## Git Flow  
I am using simpliest github flow to organize my work:  
![Github flow](https://scilifelab.github.io/software-development/img/github-flow.png)  
I have **master** , **develop** and **feature** branches.   
All features must be merged into develop branch!
Only the release should merge into the main branch!!
